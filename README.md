## Aspiring Machine Learning Engineer | Passionate about Turning Data into Intelligent Decisions and always curious to uncover how different models think, learn, and perform.  

Hi, I’m **Rohit Sai Kiran Ravula**  
I design and build **AI systems that don’t just crunch numbers — they solve real business problems**.  
With dual graduate certificates in **Artificial Intelligence (Georgian College)** and **Business Analytics (Conestoga College)**, I bridge the gap between **cutting-edge AI engineering** and **practical business value**.  

---

## My Value in One Line  
> **I specialize in transforming raw data into deployable AI solutions that are accurate, explainable, and business-driven..**

---

## Highlights  
- **Georgian Scholar (Honors)** – GPA 88.79 (Artificial Intelligence)  
- Ranked in the **Top 10%** of my cohort at Georgian College (AI Program)  
- **Distinction** – GPA 3.78 (Business Analytics)  
- Built hands-on AI/ML projects in **Computer Vision, Neural Networks, and Churn Prediction**  
- Dual background in **AI Engineering + Business Analytics** = technical + strategic edge

## Featured Work  

### [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/RohitSaiKiran/Predicting-Customer-Churn-XGBoost-CatBoost)   
**Why it matters:** Every lost customer costs 5x more to replace than to retain.  
**Impact:** Achieved Achieved ~77% accuracy, ROC AUC ~0.83, and recall ~0.71 | Identified contract type, billing method, and pricing as key churn drivers.  
**Stack:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, CatBoost, Seaborn

### [Teaching Neural Networks to Read Handwriting](https://github.com/RohitSaiKiran/Teaching_Neural_Network_to_Read_Handwriting_MNIST_PyTorch)  
**Why it matters:** Lays the foundation for document digitization & OCR systems.  
**Impact:** Trained a PyTorch model to 97–98% accuracy on MNIST.  
**Stack:** PyTorch, Torchvision, Matplotlib  

---

### [ComputerVision-OpenCV-YOLO-DemoKit](https://github.com/RohitSaiKiran/ComputerVision-OpenCV-YOLO-DemoKit)  
**Why it matters:** Combines classic CV and modern deep learning to handle diverse vision problems.  
**Impact:** Demonstrated Harris corners, watershed segmentation, and YOLOv8 object detection on real images.  
**Stack:** OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, ultralytics YOLO  

---

### [OpenCV Fundamentals Toolkit](https://github.com/RohitSaiKiran/OpenCV-Fundamentals--Image-Processing-and-Computer-Vision)  
**Why it matters:** Strong CV foundations are key to scaling advanced AI models.
